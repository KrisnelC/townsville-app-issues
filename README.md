# Townsville App Issues
The purpose of this repo is to track issues for the mobile companion app for Townsville AMSA National Convention 2016.

This readme is is designed to outline some of the basics of bug reporting to help best identify issues with the app.

#### (You can submit issues here)[https://github.com/KrisnelC/townsville-app-issues/issues]

Lets start with the basics.

## Why send a bug report?
* To tell us about issues we are not aware of
* To help us identify new features we are not aware of
* To help us get a feel for how rangers will use the app, so we can improve the experience

## When to send a bug report
In short, as often as possible. However below are a non-comprehensive list to reasons
* You see an error message, send a bug report
* The screen is blank or data is missing, send a bug report
* When the app does not behave as expected, send a bug report
* When the app crashes, freezes, becomes non-responsive or is slow, send a bug report
* When you don’t get what you need from the app, send a bug report
* If you cannot figure out how to do something, send a bug report
* If you don’t like the way it does things, or the app annoys you, send a bug report

## What it should include

A bug report should contain a lot of information, the more you supply, the better. You can find a template for issues submission (here)[]. Here is what it should contain and how to write each section:

### Title
Create a short title for the report, and please be clear what the issue is. “Application crashed” is a horrible title as it gives no information on what is included in the report. Instead, title it with the error message and code, or the thing you were doing when it failed. For example: “Error 402: Access denied when clicking ‘Save’” or “App reports error when saving profile”. Both of these provide context for the bug report.

Bad: “It crashed”, “Saw an error”, “Bug”
Good: “Error 'Your session is invalid' when logging in”

### Classification
We need to know how serious it is, is this a feature request, minor annoyance or a full blown show-stopping nuclear-reactor-melting-down armageddon bug. Try naming your issue something like; “New feature”, “Minor Annoyance”, “Crashing Bug”, “Serious Bug” or “Minor Bug”.

Bad: Leave it blank
Good: “Serious Bug”, “Annoyance”, “Feature Request”

### Platform
Tell us what you are using to run the application, especially phone make and version, they are all different, and it’s important for us to know it.
How to find your phone version:  (Android)[#android-v] / (iPhone)[https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201685]
Bad: “Android”
Good: " Phone: HTC M8, OS: 6.0 Marshmallow ”

###Can it be reproduced?
Some of the most annoying bugs are intermittent and cannot be reproduced. We’d like to know up-front if we are dealing with an oddity or an every-time bug.

Bad: Leave it blank
Good: “Every time”, “Occasionally”, “Unable to Reproduce”
