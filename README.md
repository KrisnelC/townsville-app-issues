# Townsville App Issues
The purpose of this repo is to track issues for the mobile companion app for Townsville AMSA National Convention 2016.

This readme is is designed to outline some of the basics of bug reporting to help best identify issues with the app.

Lets start with the basics

## Why send a bug report?
* To tell us about issues we are not aware of
* To help us identify new features we are not aware of
* To help us get a feel for how rangers will use the app, so we can improve the experience

## When to send a bug report
In short, as often as possible. However below are a non-comprehensive list to reasons
* You see an error message, send a bug report
* The screen is blank or data is missing, send a bug report
* When the app does not behave as expected, send a bug report
* When the app crashes, freezes, becomes non-responsive or is slow, send a bug report
* When you don’t get what you need from the app, send a bug report
* If you cannot figure out how to do something, send a bug report
